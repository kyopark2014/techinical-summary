## 특징

1) Reliably load real-time streams into data lakes, warehouses, and analytics services

2) Easily capture, transform, and load streaming data. Create a delivery stream, select your destination, and start streaming real-time data with just a few clicks.

3) Automatically provision and scale compute, memory, and network resources without ongoing administration.

4) Transform raw streaming data into formats like Apache Parquet, and dynamically partition streaming data without building your own processing pipelines.

5) Connect with 30+ fully integrated AWS services and streaming destinations such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon Redshift.


## User cases

1) Stream into data lakes and warehouses

Stream data into Amazon S3 and convert data into required formats for analysis without building processing pipelines.

2) Boost security

Monitor network security in real time and create alerts when potential threats arise using supported Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tools.

3) Build ML streaming applications

Enrich your data streams with machine learning (ML) models to analyze data and predict inference endpoints as streams move to their destination.
